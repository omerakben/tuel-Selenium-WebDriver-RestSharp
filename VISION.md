# Project Vision

Transit to Fully Open-Source TUEL exists to provide a production-grade automation framework that teams can adopt as a starting point for API and UI testing. Our goal is to demonstrate how a modern SDET organization structures test code, enforces quality, and integrates with delivery pipelines.

## Mission

- Deliver a maintainable, extensible test automation template built on .NET 8, Selenium, and RestSharp.
- Showcase architecture patterns that support enterprise use cases while remaining approachable to smaller teams.
- Encourage community collaboration and knowledge sharing within the test automation ecosystem.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Quality First** — Tests must be deterministic, readable, and trustworthy.
2. **Composability** — Page objects, API clients, and configuration should be modular and reusable.
3. **Observability** — Logging, reporting, and diagnostics are built-in, not bolt-ons.
4. **Security Aware** — Secrets management, authentication flows, and secure defaults are treated as core features.
5. **Documentation Driven** — Every major capability is explained with setup, usage, and extension examples.

## Roadmap Themes

- **Developer Experience**: Streamline local setup, provide CLI helpers, and add IDE tooling guidance.
- **Extensibility**: Allow plug-in authentication providers, reporting sinks, and custom wait strategies.
- **Reliability**: Expand health checks, add resilience patterns, and improve recovery from flaky environments.
- **Scalability**: Enable parallel execution profiles, container orchestration examples, and cloud-ready configurations.
- **Community Growth**: Publish tutorials, offer starter issues, and host periodic office hours when feasible.

## Decision-Making

- **Architecture changes** should be proposed via GitHub discussions or RFC-style issues before large pull requests.
- **Breaking changes** require a documented migration plan and must be grouped in minor or major releases.
- **Feature acceptance** is evaluated against our mission, guiding principles, and maintenance capacity.

## Success Metrics

- High contributor satisfaction (responses within 5 business days, helpful reviews).
- Automated test suite executes in under 5 minutes on standard CI hardware.
- 95%+ coverage of critical components with automated tests.
- Zero known critical security issues in supported branches.

Thank you for helping us build a sustainable, community-driven automation template! Contributions that align with this vision are always welcome.
