## Contributing Guidelines

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **Bug Fixes**: Fix existing issues
- **Feature Additions**: Add new functionality
- **Documentation**: Improve documentation
- **Test Coverage**: Add or improve tests
- **Performance Improvements**: Optimize existing code
- **Code Quality**: Refactor and improve code quality

### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplication
2. For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach
3. Ensure your changes align with the project's goals and architecture

## Pull Request Process

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-retry-mechanism`, `fix/thread-sleep-issue`)

2. **Commit Messages**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages:
   ```
   feat: add retry mechanism for API calls
   fix: replace Thread.Sleep with WebDriverWait
   docs: update README with setup instructions
   ```

3. **Pull Request Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title

4. **Pull Request Description**: Include:
   - What changes were made
   - Why the changes were necessary
   - How to test the changes
   - Any breaking changes
   - Screenshots (for UI changes)

### Pull Request Requirements

- [ ] Code follows the project's coding standards
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] New tests are added for new functionality
- [ ] Documentation is updated if necessary
- [ ] No breaking changes (or clearly documented)
- [ ] Code is properly formatted
- [ ] No sensitive information is included

## Issue Reporting

### Before Reporting an Issue

1. Check if the issue already exists
2. Try to reproduce the issue
3. Gather relevant information

### Issue Template

When reporting an issue, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the issue
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Expected Behavior**: What you expected to happen
- **Actual Behavior**: What actually happened
- **Environment**: OS, .NET version, browser version
- **Screenshots**: If applicable
- **Logs**: Relevant error messages or logs

## Coding Standards

### C# Coding Standards

- Follow Microsoft's C# coding conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation for public APIs
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Prefer `var` for local variables when type is obvious
- Use nullable reference types appropriately

### Test Standards

- Write descriptive test method names
- Use the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- One assertion per test when possible
- Use meaningful test data
- Clean up resources in test cleanup

### Code Organization

- Keep classes focused and single-purpose
- Use appropriate access modifiers
- Group related functionality together
- Follow the existing project structure

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- New features must include comprehensive tests
- Bug fixes must include tests that prevent regression
- Aim for high test coverage (>90%)

### Test Types

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual methods and classes
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **API Tests**: Test API endpoints
- **UI Tests**: Test user interface functionality

### Test Naming Convention

```csharp
[TestMethod]
[Description("Verifies that the API returns a successful status code")]
public async Task GetProducts_Returns_Status_OK()
{
    // Test implementation
}
```
